# Coments

  1. Train size > 3 million rows. Test size > 1 million rows.
  2. The clients in both files are different. Train > 1/2 million clients. Test > 1/4 million clients.
  3. There are almost 16% and 11% of clients with only one product in test and train, respectively.
  4. There are the same products in both files.
  5. Products are never repeated.
  6. Socio_Demographic values ARE ALWAYS CONSTANT on the user. Meaning they correspond to the time being (2017) and not when the product was bought.
  7. The clients that bought products long time ago didn't have the same options (products were not available, not yet developed) so we can not take their decisions as significant.
